You need to install esptool from Espressif's ESP-IDF

esptool is a python script to program your ESP32. See https://github.com/espressif/esptool

Then run one of the batch files based on the serial port you're ESP32 is connected to. They're all the same batch files, just tweak it if you end up with your ESP32 on a different serial port or if you're not on Windows, just transpose that command line to your appropriate OS.
